# MicroBitNameTag
Code for using the Microbit as a nametag that will greet other persons with the same tag with their own name

The code will scroll your name onthe microbit screen. As soon as another microbit with the same code is in range, your microbit will greet that person with an "Hello" followed by the name of the persion. 

You need at lest 2 microbits for this project.

The code uses the RSSI signal strenght to deside if the other person is "close enough" the default setting will consider ~2 meters as "close enough", but tht depengs on a lot of factors, so some experiemnting with the treshold might be needed.
